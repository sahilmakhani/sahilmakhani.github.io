        <p>When you view a web page in your browser, you are seeing the interrupted code that you type into your text editor. Web pages are made of text which is called "Marked Up", or formatted using Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML. The HTML codes, known as tags, are placed around the text that you want to format. In most cases, when formating text, you will have both an opening or closing tag to indicate where the formatting showld start and where it should end.</p>

        <p>Content on a web page is located inside elements. There are basically 2 types of elements, block and inline. This content is being written inside a paragraph element, which is a block element because there will be a space above and below the paragraph essentially blocking off the content. <strong>However this content is in a strong element which is inline. Inline elements do not separate the content.</strong> Block elements will effect a pages layout, where inline elements do not.</p>

        <p>There are all different types of elemments that go to make up a web page. The elements used on this page is the HTML, which is also called the root element, the head element, body element, heading element, paragraph element, and the strong incline element. The elements used on this page, other than the strong element, are the minimum that any web page should include. In the next lab you will include some of the other elements used to organize content on a web page.</p>
