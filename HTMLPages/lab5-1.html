        <h2>The Starry Night</h2>
        
        <p>Vincent Van Gogh painted Starry Night in 1889 during his stay at the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near Saint-Remy-de-Provence. Van Gogh lived well in the hospital; he was allowed more freedoms than any of the other patients. If attended, he could leave the hospital grounds; he was allowed to paint, read, and withdraw into his own room.</p>

       <h2>Sunflowers</h2>
        
        <p>Van Gogh's paintings of sunflowers were his most famous. He did them in Arles, in the South of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of 5 large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with 3 shades of yellow 'and nothing else'. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single color, without any loss of eloquence.</p>
